# Classification_basic_v1
This exercise arises from the need to explain to a client what conditions a database must meet in order to be modeled in GCP autoML in a classification model.  It consists of 3 parts, the general exploration of the variables in shape conditions, the exploration in conditions of linear and / or non-linear correlation and the prediction with a classification model by LogisticRegression from sklearn. Although it is not my favorite classification technique, in this case it meets both the criteria of ease to explain to the client the business philosophy behind the process.
